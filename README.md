# Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard in Power BI

## Introduction
This project focuses on data analysis for Sustainable Supply Chain Performance using a Power BI dashboard. It provides insights into the processes used in Power BI for analyzing and visualizing data effectively.

## Understanding ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
ETL is a process that involves:
- **Extract**: Retrieving data from source files (e.g., Excel, CSV, text, or database files).
- **Transform**: Processing and cleaning the data for analysis.
- **Load**: Importing the cleaned data into the Power BI dashboard for visualization.

## Installing Power BI
1. Visit the official Microsoft website and download Power BI for Windows.
2. Follow the installation instructions, then open the software.
3. Start with a **Blank Report**, which opens the Power BI Dashboard window.
4. Click on **Blank Report** to open it and view the **Power BI Dashboard** window.
5. On the right-hand side, different types of charts are available for building the dashboard. The central window, called the **canvas**, is where these charts are built.
6. Extract data using **Get Data**, which supports multiple formats such as SQL Server, Web, Text, and CSV.
7. Transform the data and check for cleanliness before loading it.

## Steps for Working in Power BI
1. Extract and load data, then perform transformations as needed.
2. Click on **Transform Data** to open **Power Query Editor**.
3. In Power Query Editor, perform operations like choosing/removing columns, filtering rows, and merging queries.
4. The **View** section allows checking **Column Quality**, which shows valid, error, and empty values.
5. Data types for columns include decimal number, whole number, text, date, time, etc.
6. To duplicate a table, right-click on it and select **Duplicate**.
